**AMR in Cancer**

Oncology patients on chemotherapy are at particular risk for bacterial, and fungal infections and bloodstream infection remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing treatment for cancer which causes life-threatening complications and a significantly elevated risk of infection-related death .More than half of all cancer cases and about 60% of deaths occur in developing countries. Infection-related mortality affects the survival rates of patients who are receiving treatment for cancer\[1\].

**Drug Resistance** 

occurs when microorganisms, including bacteria, evolve mechanisms to evade the effects of drugs designed to kill them or inhibit their growth. In cancer patients, who often have weakened immune systems, this resistance can lead to severe complications. \[2\], \[3\].

**Antibiotics** 

Originally, they are biochemical substances produced by microorganism to inhibit the growth of another microorganism and they are classified into nature, semisynthetic and synthetic 

are crucial for managing infections in cancer patients, but their overuse or misuse can cause the development of resistance. Inappropriate antibiotic use can lead to the proliferation of resistant strains, making it harder to treat infections effectively.\[4\]

another classification according to their mechanism:

**Aminoglycosides:** Antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria, 

**Quinolones:** Antibiotics that block DNA replication in bacteria

**Beta-Lactams:** Antibiotics that disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis, 

Bactericidal agents kill bacteria directly, the vegetative cell and spore cell.

Bacteriostatic agents inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria without necessarily killing them. They prevent bacteria from multiplying.

**Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria **

Bacteria are classified based on their cell wall structure, which is identified using the Gram stain. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell wall,  giving the crystal violet dye and appearing purple under the microscope. Examples include *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. Gram-negative bacteria have a thinner peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which can trigger strong immune responses. They appear pink or red after staining. Examples include *Escherichia coli* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. This classification is crucial for determining antibiotic susceptibility and understanding bacterial pathogenicity.\[5\], \[6\]

**Serial Dilution**

Serial dilution is a laboratory technique used to Convert a dense solution into a more usable concentration by stepwise dilution with an associated dilution factor.

**Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) vs. Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC)**

MIC is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth, while MBC is the lowest concentration that kills the bacteria. 

**EUCAST vs. CLSI**

These are two different guidelines for interpreting antibiotic susceptibility tests. EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) and CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute).\[7\]
**Conclusion**
Effective infection management is critical for oncology patients due to their high risk of severe infections and complications from drug-resistant bacteria. Understanding the mechanisms of antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, quinolones, and beta-lactams, and distinguishing between bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects helps guide appropriate treatment. The classification of bacteria into Gram-positive and Gram-negative is essential for selecting effective antibiotics. Additionally, techniques like serial dilution, and understanding MIC and MBC values, help optimize dosing. Following guidelines from EUCAST and CLSI ensures accurate antibiotic use. Mastery of these concepts is crucial to improving patient outcomes and reducing infection-related deaths in cancer care.
